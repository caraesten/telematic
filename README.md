## TELEMATIC

This is a tool to make telnet connections over serial much easier.

The idea is simple: you run this script, you plug in a cable, you hit enter, and you're presented with a list of telnet servers from the json config. Select one, and you're online!

### Dependencies
- PySerial

### FYIs
- the telematic.json config is just my personal one, go ahead and fork this repo + add yr own!
